Welcome to the 2.0 version of C3327923's Encryption and Decryption
code. To use said code, you first must open the input file. There 
on the first lineyou must enter a number to chose which option you 
want to run. The choices are:
1 for Rotation Encryption
2 for Rotation Decryption
3 for Subsation Encryption
4 for Subsation Decryption
Anything else will quit the program.
After you will have to enter a message to be encrypted or decrypted
on the next line. Finally, you must enter a key for the program, (if 
no key is used enter 0). The code will either produce some possible
decryption outcomes or an encrypted message in the terminal, and in
file Endgame.
Have fun using it.
